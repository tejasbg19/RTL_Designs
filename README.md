# RTL and Architecture Projects by Tejas

This repository contains practical Verilog/SystemVerilog projects developed during my 6th and 7th semester coursework, including:

- NPTEL: Hardware Modelling using Verilog (Indraneil Sengupta)
- NPTEL: Computer Architecture (Smruti R. Sarangi)

Each subfolder contains synthesizable RTL, testbenches, waveforms, and synthesis artifacts (gate-level netlists or schematics).
